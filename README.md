# JavaScript Null and Undefined Handling Error

This example shows a common error in JavaScript where code attempts to access the `length` property of an object that might not have that property or may be null/undefined.  This can lead to a `TypeError`.  The solution demonstrates robust handling of these cases.

## Bug

The `foo` function attempts to access `x.length`, which can throw an error if `x` is not an array or a string or is null/undefined. 

## Solution

The improved version checks if `x` is null or undefined and handles these scenarios appropriately.  It also checks if `x` has a `length` property before accessing it.
